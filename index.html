          doctoral thesis.

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Modern software systems tend to be large and complex, evolving rapidly
          to the point where a single developer cannot oversee all aspects of
          the software, or fully understand the implications of every change.
          Thus, the development of modern software systems requires extensive
          collaboration among professionals with diverse technical skills and
          domain knowledge to manage the increasing complexity of the developed
          systems. One way that both industry and open-source projects
          facilitate collaboration is through code reviews. In code reviews,
          people discuss changes to artifacts before they are integrated into
          the codebase. Code reviews offer several benefits, including improving
          code quality by identifying bugs, highlighting sub par solutions,
          technical debt, and suggesting alternative approaches. Additionally,
          code reviews facilitate knowledge sharing among developers and testers
          within a team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Software testing, as part of the software development process,
          requires similar collaborative efforts as production code. Among the
          various testing approaches, graphical user interface (GUI)-based
          testing stands out as a technique that validates a systemâ€™s behavior
          through its visual interface, simulating real-world user interaction.
          By interacting with the GUI, GUI-based testing enables the assessment
          of both the visual appearance and functional correctness of the system
          under test (SUT). In industry, GUI-based testing is performed manually
          and as automated tests. We specifically focus on automated GUI-based
          testing, where test cases are written as scripts (code) along with
          supporting artifacts that enable automation. This focus is motivated
          by the fact that code-based test scripts closely resemble production
          code, which is the typical subject of code review practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Existing academic literature primarily focuses on code review for
          production code and low-level tests, such as unit tests. This
          highlights a gap in understanding code review practices related to
          GUI-based testing. Specifically, practices, guidelines, and
          information needs specific to GUI-based testing have not been
          thoroughly explored in the academic field.
        </p>

        <h3>Thesis Objective</h3>
        <p>
          The aim of this thesis is to develop and empirically validate
          actionable guidelines for reviewing code in GUI-based tests, while
          also highlighting the practices and challenges encountered during
          these reviews to enhance collaborative efforts in GUI-based testing.
        </p>
        Accordingly, this thesis aims to
        <ol>
          <li>
            Identify code review guidelines that can be used for GUI-based
            testing
          </li>
          <li>
            Investigate the specific practices, challenges, and information
            needs encountered when reviewing GUI-based testing files
          </li>
          <li>Empirically evaluate proposed guidelines</li>
          <li>
            Provide an outlook on how code reviews as a collaborative practice
            may evolve in the future
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <p>
          We combine exploratory (Studies 1, 2, and 4) and confirmatory (Study
          3) research.
        </p>
        <p>
          To identify the state of the art in review artifacts, we conducted a
          Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) using white and gray literature to
          identify guidelines for source and test code. The synthesized
          guidelines are then mapped to create actionable guidelines for
          GUI-based testing files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, to capture aspects of code reviews beyond guidelines for
          artifacts, we conducted a qualitative interview study with 14 software
          testing professionals from six different companies. In this interview
          study, we investigate the specific practices, challenges, and
          information needs encountered when reviewing GUI-based testing files.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to bridge this gap in knowledge on the proposed code review
          guidelines that could aid the code review process, through an
          empirical evaluation, through a confirmatory, theory-testing approach.
          For this, we conducted a Mining Software Repository Study (MSR) by
          gathering code review data from 100 open-source repositories hosted on
          GitHub that discusses GUI-based test files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we conducted a questionnaire survey with 92 practitioners to
          gather their expectations and discuss the future of code reviews. This
          survey should provide an outlook on whether perceived importance of
          code reviews in the future.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          Due to the absence of specifically mentioned code review guidelines
          for GUI-based testing in academic literature, we identified and mapped
          33 guidelines across nine categories that are applicable to GUI-based
          testing. These guidelines primarily focus on the files under review,
          aiming to improve the quality of changes, rather than addressing the
          review process itself, such as identifying suitable reviewers for the
          changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although participants recognize the importance of code reviews, they
          do not follow any explicit defined practices when reviewing GUI-based
          tests, but instead relying on ad-hoc methods. We documented four
          practices commonly adopted by practitioners when reviewing GUI-based
          test files. The most frequently reported practice was running tests on
          local machines, which highlights the lack of test-specific information
          in code review tools. Additionally, six challenges were identified,
          which included both test-specific issues, such as ensuring proper
          validation of the System Under Test (SUT), as well as more general
          concerns, such as understandability, readability, and maintenance.
          Furthermore, practitioners expressed a need for additional information
          during reviews, including context about the SUT, coverage and
          performance metrics, test data, and logging information. Finally, we
          collected feedback for future improvements in tools and practices for
          code reviews.
        </p>
        <p>
          In analyzing GitHub code review comments, we found empirical evidence
          supporting 26 out of the 33 proposed guidelines from Study 1. Our
          findings indicate that many of the guidelines derived from academic
          literature are already implicitly adopted in practice. Notably, the
          most observed guideline of "Ensure proper usage of techniques for
          testing and exception handling" is particularly relevant to GUI-based
          testing, as it addresses the use of locators to identify GUI elements
          and the implementation of waiting/timeout behaviors between test
          steps. This demonstrates the value of these guidelines as a foundation
          for enhancing the consistency of GUI-based test reviews and improving
          test quality. Our set of empirically evaluated guidelines is now
          explicitly articulated for GUI-based testing files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the results of our survey indicate that practitioners expect
          an increase in code review activities across a wider range of
          artifacts. Specifically, GUI-based test artifacts (end-to-end testing)
          are receiving increased attention. This emphasizes that our focus on
          code reviews as a collaborative practice, both in general and for
          GUI-based testing, is viewed as a valuable practice that will continue
          to grow in importance. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are
          anticipated to transform both code contributions and reviews,
          potentially moving code reviews away from being purely human-centered,
          the practice of code review remains essential in software engineering
          and development endeavors.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          This thesis enhances the understanding of code reviews as a
          collaborative practice in the context of GUI-based test files, an area
          that has not been extensively studied. We proposed and empirically
          evaluated guidelines to improve the code review process, highlighting
          current practices and the challenges that practitioners face when
          reviewing GUI-based tests.
